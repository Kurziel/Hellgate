Credit and thanks to many many people, I've tried very hard to make sure anybody that has influenced the mod or I've taken assests or code from are included here:

Magoli for the Prefab Compopack
Valmar for his countless contributions to the community and his fantastic work, starter kits are of course based off his work.
Tin for his RWG terrain generation
Doc Saturn for his banded biome generation
Brainstorm by Stephen JB Thomas from the Noun Project, used as the sanity icon
Sirillion for the UI unit frame and UI textures (from his SMX UI Mod)
Chaosocks for inspiration from his Walking Dead Mod
